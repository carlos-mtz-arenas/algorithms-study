# Goal

The goal of this repository is to have a starting point to study data structures and algorithms

# Topics

## data structures

- [ ] High level overview
- [ ] Identify when a data structure is better than another one
- [ ] Examples of using data structures for OS-type of processes

## big o notation

- [ ] Intro to big o notation
- [ ] High level and most common cases
- [ ] Time complexity vs space complexity

## algorithms

- [ ] Types/Families
- [ ] Practice examples for each family

# Structure

We'll have a subdirectory for each project so that we can test out different technologies to implement the examples related to the topics we're working on. For example:

```
repository/
  java/the-java-project-name/*
  kotlin/the-kotlin-project-name/*
```
